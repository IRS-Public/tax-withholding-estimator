### _TWE 2.0 Product Onboarding Checklist_

**1. Product Strategy & Roadmap**

- [ ] Walk through **TWE 2.0 vision, strategy, and goals** (why this matters, how it improves taxpayer experience).
- [ ] Share the **roadmap and milestone plan** (M1, M2, M3), including where we are today.
- [ ] Explain the **relationship between TWE 1.0 and 2.0** (why 1.0 is paused, focus shifted to 2.0).
- [ ] Review IRS stakeholders and decision makers 
- [ ]  **Provide context on OB3 changes** (changes to deductions worksheet, W4, etc.)

**2. Prioritization & Operating Model**

- [ ] Explain how epics and tickets are prioritized (epic format, milestone alignment, dependencies).
- [ ] Clarify how refinements work (Design frames → PM prioritization → Engineering tickets).
- [ ] Review cadence (standups, refinements, demos, partner syncs) and where product fits.

**3. Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done**

- [ ] Share acceptance criteria templates used for tickets and scenarios.
- [ ] Define the “definition of done” for TWE 2.0 (working logic, tested flow, demo-ready).
- [ ] Clarify how testing and validation tie into demos and milestone sign-off.


**4. Quick Wins for New Joiners**

- [ ] Review open tickets in current sprint and note where product input is needed.
- [ ] Contribute to refinement by helping frame at least one requirement or epic.
- [ ] Draft a short update in Slack (yesterday/today/blockers) to practice team cadence.
- [ ] Partner with engineering/design on one scenario to see end-to-end flow.

**5. Culture & Norms**

- [ ] Use Slack threads to keep conversations organized.
- [ ] Document decisions in epics and notes for visibility.
- [ ] Celebrate wins with team recognition posts (“Hurrah” culture).
- [ ] Ask clarifying questions early and often. We're figuring it out together!
