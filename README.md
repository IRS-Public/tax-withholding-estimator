# Scriber

A static site generator for creating forms that fill out Fact Graphs.

Right now this is purpose-built for TWE, but I've done what I can to write it as generically as possible.

## Setup

You will need the Fact Graph downloaded and published to a local repository.

`make dev` - Automatically recompile and run on code changes
