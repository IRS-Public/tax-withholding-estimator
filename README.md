# Tax Withholding Estimator

An online website for a taxpayer to estimate their withholdings.

It is powered by a static site generator that turns FlowXML into multi-page forms.
Right now this static site generator is purpose-built for TWE, but I've done what I can to write it as generically as
possible.
