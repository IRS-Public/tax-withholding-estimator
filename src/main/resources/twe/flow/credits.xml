      <h2>Credits</h2>

      <p>
        Credits directly reduce the amount of tax you owe, dollar for dollar.
        Unlike deductions or adjustments, which lower taxable income, credits lower your tax bill itself.
        Some credits can even increase your refund if the credit is larger than the tax you owe.
      </p>
      <p>
        This estimator only supports some credits.
        There may be other credits you qualify for that could impact your estimate.
