# Note that these errors use CamelCase because they come from the Fact Graph. Some of these errors
# are user errors (i.e. they entered an amount larger than the limit) but not all of them are (i.e.
# if the limit is misconfigured). I've tried to the denote the ones that should only appear if
# there's a bug that needs to be fixed.
errors:
  # Dollar errors
  CombinedHyphensAndParentheses: Enter only numbers and a decimal.
  # Not obvious to me why the fact graph breaks down invalid characters
  # this way but I don't think it needs to be exposed to the user
  InvalidCharacters: Enter only numbers and a decimal.
  InvalidDollar: Enter only numbers and a decimal.
  InvalidHyphens: Enter only numbers and a decimal.
  InvalidParentheses: Enter only numbers and a decimal.
  TooManyDecimals: Enter a number with only one decimal.
  TooManyFractionalDigits: Enter only two digits after the decimal.

  # Day errors
  InvalidDay: Enter a valid day.
  InvalidDayDueToLeapYear: Invalid day due to leap year.
  InvalidMonth: Enter a valid month.
  InvalidDate: Enter a valid date.
  InvalidLimit: Invalid limit set. # Server error

  # Enum errors
  BlankEnum: Value was blank. # Server error
  InvalidEnum: Value not found. # Server error

  Default: Sorry, something went wrong # Server error

  # Limit errors
  #
  # There are a few other limits types in the Fact Graph, but we don't use them for TWE. Strangely,
  # Dollar et. al. have their own limit validations, like ExceedsMaxLimit. I don't know under what
  # circumstances those would trigger; I think it's a vestige of a different way of setting limits
  #
  # Yes, it would be nice to do proper parameterization rather than just appending the limit value
  # to the end of the string
  Max: Enter an amount less than
  Min: Enter an amount more than
