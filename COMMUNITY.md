See [TWE Open Source Community Guidelines](#twe-open-source-community-guidelines) on principles and guidelines for participating in this open source project.

## Roles & Responsibilities

The maintainers of the TWE open source project are responsible for guiding its development, ensuring quality standards, and fostering a collaborative environment. While we can accept issues and PRs in draft state as contribution, as it stands today this repository does not support external contributors outside of the IRS.

Because this project is currently maintained by a small internal team, the core maintainers also serve as the sole approvers and reviewers for all code changes.

### Maintainers, Approvers, and Reviewers:
- @sps-irs
- @petrosgov

## Contributors

Currently, contributions are limited to IRS affiliated staff, but we welcome and intend to incorporate feedback, through issues or draft PRs as part of our internal development lifecycle.

## TWE Open Source Community Guidelines

The below contains principles and guidelines for participating in the TWE open source community.

### Principles

These principles guide our data, product, and process decisions, architecture, and approach.

- "Open" means transparent and participatory.
- We take a modular and modern approach to software development.
- We build open-source software and open-source process.
- We value simplicity of implementation.
- Fostering community includes building capacity and making our software and processes accessible to participants with diverse backgrounds and skillsets.
- We strive for transparency for algorithms and places we might be introducing bias.

### Community Guidelines

All community members are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Information on contributing to this repository is available in our [Contributing file](CONTRIBUTING.md).

When participating in the TWE open source community conversations and spaces, we ask individuals to follow the following guidelines:

- When joining a conversation for the first time, please introduce yourself by providing a brief intro and include your related organization (if applicable).
- Embrace a culture of learning, and educate each other. We are all entering this conversation from different starting points and with different backgrounds. There are no dumb questions.
- Take space and give space. We strive to create an equitable environment in which all are welcome and able to participate. We hope individuals feel comfortable voicing their opinions and providing contributions and will do our best to recognize and make space for individuals who may be struggling to find space here. Likewise, we expect individuals to recognize when they are taking up significant space and take a step back to allow room for others.
- Be respectful.
- Default to positive. Assume others' contributions are legitimate and valuable and that they are made with good intention.
